First time using Talend Open Studio|Intern|Computer Softwar|201-500 employees|Less than 6 months|Overall: My experience with TOS was interesting, since it introduced me to a new world of data analysis, it allowed me to know and demonstrate how data works and how it can be controlled, tabulated and even graphed with the help of other linked tools. Pros: For the type of work I did at the university, I used TOS for the analysis and treatment of a data stream provided by the university, which consisted of working with the hundreds of data that this stream received every day. Having explained that, what I liked the most about this tool was its dynamic and fully equipped environment at the time of working, in addition to that, its API seemed impressive to me since it had explanatory text for each subtool and with examples in real time for a better understanding. , and last but not least I liked the ease of installation of this tool and the ease of creating a working environment. Cons: In general there were no bad events or events with the tool, however, it does have a function to download and deploy "components" external to those that come with the default tool. One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023

First time using Talend Open Studio|Intern|Computer Softwar|201-500 employees|Less than 6 months|Overall: My experience with TOS was interesting, since it introduced me to a new world of data analysis, it allowed me to know and demonstrate how data works and how it can be controlled, tabulated and even graphed with the help of other linked tools. Pros: For the type of work I did at the university, I used TOS for the analysis and treatment of a data stream provided by the university, which consisted of working with the hundreds of data that this stream received every day. Having explained that, what I liked the most about this tool was its dynamic and fully equipped environment at the time of working, in addition to that, its API seemed impressive to me since it had explanatory text for each subtool and with examples in real time for a better understanding. , and last but not least I liked the ease of installation of this tool and the ease of creating a working environment. Cons: In general there were no bad events or events with the tool, however, it does have a function to download and deploy "components" external to those that come with the default tool. One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023

First time using Talend Open Studio|Intern|Computer Softwar|201-500 employees|Less than 6 months|Overall: My experience with TOS was interesting, since it introduced me to a new world of data analysis, it allowed me to know and demonstrate how data works and how it can be controlled, tabulated and even graphed with the help of other linked tools. Pros: For the type of work I did at the university, I used TOS for the analysis and treatment of a data stream provided by the university, which consisted of working with the hundreds of data that this stream received every day. Having explained that, what I liked the most about this tool was its dynamic and fully equipped environment at the time of working, in addition to that, its API seemed impressive to me since it had explanatory text for each subtool and with examples in real time for a better understanding. , and last but not least I liked the ease of installation of this tool and the ease of creating a working environment. Cons: In general there were no bad events or events with the tool, however, it does have a function to download and deploy "components" external to those that come with the default tool. One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023

One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023

First time using Talend Open Studio|Intern|Computer Softwar|201-500 employees|Less than 6 months|Overall: My experience with TOS was interesting, since it introduced me to a new world of data analysis, it allowed me to know and demonstrate how data works and how it can be controlled, tabulated and even graphed with the help of other linked tools. Pros: For the type of work I did at the university, I used TOS for the analysis and treatment of a data stream provided by the university, which consisted of working with the hundreds of data that this stream received every day. Having explained that, what I liked the most about this tool was its dynamic and fully equipped environment at the time of working, in addition to that, its API seemed impressive to me since it had explanatory text for each subtool and with examples in real time for a better understanding. , and last but not least I liked the ease of installation of this tool and the ease of creating a working environment. Cons: In general there were no bad events or events with the tool, however, it does have a function to download and deploy "components" external to those that come with the default tool. One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023

First time using Talend Open Studio|Intern|Computer Softwar|201-500 employees|Less than 6 months|Overall: My experience with TOS was interesting, since it introduced me to a new world of data analysis, it allowed me to know and demonstrate how data works and how it can be controlled, tabulated and even graphed with the help of other linked tools. Pros: For the type of work I did at the university, I used TOS for the analysis and treatment of a data stream provided by the university, which consisted of working with the hundreds of data that this stream received every day. Having explained that, what I liked the most about this tool was its dynamic and fully equipped environment at the time of working, in addition to that, its API seemed impressive to me since it had explanatory text for each subtool and with examples in real time for a better understanding. , and last but not least I liked the ease of installation of this tool and the ease of creating a working environment. Cons: In general there were no bad events or events with the tool, however, it does have a function to download and deploy "components" external to those that come with the default tool. One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023

First time using Talend Open Studio|Intern|Computer Softwar|201-500 employees|Less than 6 months|Overall: My experience with TOS was interesting, since it introduced me to a new world of data analysis, it allowed me to know and demonstrate how data works and how it can be controlled, tabulated and even graphed with the help of other linked tools. Pros: For the type of work I did at the university, I used TOS for the analysis and treatment of a data stream provided by the university, which consisted of working with the hundreds of data that this stream received every day. Having explained that, what I liked the most about this tool was its dynamic and fully equipped environment at the time of working, in addition to that, its API seemed impressive to me since it had explanatory text for each subtool and with examples in real time for a better understanding. , and last but not least I liked the ease of installation of this tool and the ease of creating a working environment. Cons: In general there were no bad events or events with the tool, however, it does have a function to download and deploy "components" external to those that come with the default tool. One piece of advice given by my teacher in charge was to download other components from the official Talend page, called "Talend Exchange", but when I entered that page it never loaded, and it gave me the same error "Bad request to server. Please contact your UForge support." I resorted to many solutions but none worked for me, so it delayed the development of my project. Reasons for Choosing Talend Open Studio: I chose TOS because my teacher in charge recommended it to me to start working with data streams, since he has worked with Talend for 5 years or more. |March 29, 2023
